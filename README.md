# sea-slug-egg-pattern-simulator

A sea slug egg laying pattern simulation

## üåê Live Demo

**Static Web Version**: https://emily-li.github.io/sea-slug-egg-pattern-simulator

## How to Use

1. **Select Species & Environment**: Choose from scientifically-modeled species and set conditions
2. **Watch Pattern Formation**: Use autoplay to see the complete laying process unfold
3. **Step Through**: Use the control buttons to examine specific moments
4. **Compare Patterns**: Try different species to see how laying behaviors differ

## Visualization Modes

### Species

The following presets are available

- **Pacific Sea Lemon** - Large anticlockwise spiral ribbons (up to 2M eggs)
- **Spanish Dancer Nudibranch** - Rose-like ruffled spirals with defensive toxins
- **Vayssierea felis** - Small strategic clusters with direct development (1-5 eggs)
- **Aglajid Sea Slug** - Unique coil patterns formed by body rotation

### Egg laying patterns

- **Spiral Patterns**: Anticlockwise/clockwise spirals form from center outward
- **Ribbon Patterns**: Sinusoidal ribbons laid in flowing motions
- **Cluster Patterns**: Discretely placed clusters
- **Coil Patterns**: Tube-like coils forming through body rotation

## Local setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Simulation
